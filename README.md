# Petz SCP Reader

Reads .scp files from the Petz games and translates into a human-readable output file. Some example .scps are included.

**Tip:** .scps can be extracted from breedfiles/.dlls with [LNZ Pro](http://www.sherlocksoftware.org/page.php?id=14).

## How to use

Download and run `npm install`

Once installed, ensure the .scp file is in the root directory and run:

`node reader.js (scp filename)`

e.g.

`node reader.js mouse.scp`

See output.txt for results.
